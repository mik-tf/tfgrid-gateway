# ThreeFold Grid IPv4 Gateway

A complete solution for deploying IPv4 gateway VMs on ThreeFold Grid using Terraform/OpenTofu for infrastructure provisioning and automated configuration for secure network connectivity.

## Overview

This repository combines infrastructure provisioning via Terraform/OpenTofu with automated gateway configuration. The entire deployment process is automated through a single command, creating gateway VMs with public IPv4 addresses that enable internet access for IPv6-only workloads through NAT, proxies, WireGuard VPNs, and Mycelium network integration.

### Features

- **Public IPv4 Gateway**: VMs with dedicated public IPv4 addresses for internet connectivity
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Provisions all necessary infrastructure using Terraform/OpenTofu
- **NAT & Proxy Support**: Multiple gateway implementation approaches (NAT, reverse proxies, TCP/UDP proxies)
- **WireGuard Integration**: Secure VPN tunnels between gateway and internal VMs
- **Mycelium Integration**: End-to-end encrypted IPv6 overlay network for all VMs
- **Automated Deployment**: Single command deployment with `make`
- **Flexible Networking**: Support for various network topologies and security configurations
- **Ready for Workloads**: Pre-configured for deploying your applications behind the gateway

## Architecture

The gateway deployment consists of:

1. **Gateway VMs**: Run on ThreeFold Grid with public IPv4 addresses, providing internet access
2. **Internal VMs**: IPv6-only VMs that connect through the gateway for external connectivity
3. **Secure Networks**: WireGuard VPNs and Mycelium overlay networks for encrypted communication

The gateway VMs live within the same network as your internal VMs, providing secure management and connectivity without exposing internal resources to the public internet.

## Prerequisites

- Linux/macOS system with bash
- [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) (or Terraform) installed
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) installed
- [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) installed (required for Ansible connectivity to VMs)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) installed
- ThreeFold account with sufficient TFT balance

**Important**: WireGuard must be installed and `make wireguard` must be run before Ansible can connect to the internal VMs.

### Installing Ansible Dependencies

```bash
# Install Ansible collections and roles
cd platform
ansible-galaxy collection install -r platform/requirements.yml
ansible-galaxy role install -r platform/requirements.yml
```

### One-Command Deployment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mik-tf/tfgrid-gateway
cd tfgrid-gateway
cp infrastructure/credentials.auto.tfvars.example infrastructure/credentials.auto.tfvars
nano infrastructure/credentials.auto.tfvars  # Configure your node IDs

# Set your mnemonic (choose one method):
# Option 1: From standard ThreeFold config
export TF_VAR_mnemonic=$(cat ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic)
# Or for Fish shell: set -x TF_VAR_mnemonic (cat ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic)

# Option 2: Manual entry
export TF_VAR_mnemonic="your_mnemonic_here"

make  # Deploy everything automatically!
```

### Step-by-Step Deployment (Recommended for First Time)
```bash
# 1. Deploy infrastructure
make infrastructure

# 2. Generate Ansible inventory
make inventory

# 3. Set up local WireGuard connection (required for Ansible)
make wireguard

# 4. Configure gateway with Ansible
make ansible

# 5. Deploy gateway demo (includes VM websites)
make demo

# 6. Test everything
make demo-test
curl http://YOUR_GATEWAY_IP:8081  # VM7 website
curl http://YOUR_GATEWAY_IP:8082  # VM8 website
```

### Access Your Gateway
After deployment, you'll get a public IPv4 address. Access your services at:
- `http://YOUR_IP:8081` ‚Üí Internal VM 1
- `http://YOUR_IP:8082` ‚Üí Internal VM 2
- `http://YOUR_IP/web1` ‚Üí VM 1 (proxy mode)
- `http://YOUR_IP/web2` ‚Üí VM 2 (proxy mode)

üìñ **Detailed Guide**: [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md)

### Gateway Types

Choose your gateway configuration by setting the `GATEWAY_TYPE` environment variable:

```bash
# NAT-based gateway (default)
export GATEWAY_TYPE=gateway_nat
make ansible

## Deployment Process

The deployment happens in distinct phases, which can be run individually or together:

### 1. Infrastructure Deployment (`make infrastructure`)

Runs `scripts/infrastructure.sh`, which:
- Cleans up any previous infrastructure
- Initializes and applies Terraform/OpenTofu configuration
- Sets up WireGuard connections between VMs
- Generates the Ansible inventory based on deployed nodes
- Tests connectivity to all VMs

### 2. Gateway Configuration (`make ansible`)

Runs Ansible playbook, which:
- Configures NAT rules on gateway VMs
- Sets up proxy services (optional)
- Configures firewall rules
- Enables Mycelium networking
- Tests gateway functionality

## Using the Gateway

After deployment completes, you'll receive the gateway VM's public IPv4 address.

### Connecting to the Gateway VM

```bash
# Connect to the gateway VM
make connect

# Or directly:
ssh root@<gateway-vm-public-ip>
```

### Managing Your Gateway

Once connected to the gateway VM, you can:

```bash
# Check gateway status
sudo nft list ruleset

# View WireGuard connections
sudo wg show

# Check Mycelium connectivity
mycelium inspect --json

# Monitor NAT statistics
sudo nft list table ip nat
```

## Testing and Monitoring Commands

The tfgrid-gateway project includes comprehensive testing and monitoring tools to validate your deployment and troubleshoot issues.

### Network Address Discovery

```bash
# Show all VM addresses and connection information
make address
```
