### Features

- **Public IPv4 Gateway**: VMs with dedicated public IPv4 addresses for internet connectivity
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Provisions all necessary infrastructure using Terraform/OpenTofu
- **NAT & Proxy Support**: Multiple gateway implementation approaches (NAT, reverse proxies, TCP/UDP proxies)
- **WireGuard Integration**: Secure VPN tunnels between gateway and internal VMs
- **Mycelium Integration**: End-to-end encrypted IPv6 overlay network for all VMs
- **Automated Deployment**: Single command deployment with `make`
- **Flexible Networking**: Support for various network topologies and security configurations
- **Ready for Workloads**: Pre-configured for deploying your applications behind the gateway

## Architecture

The gateway deployment consists of:

1. **Gateway VMs**: Run on ThreeFold Grid with public IPv4 addresses, providing internet access
2. **Internal VMs**: IPv6-only VMs that connect through the gateway for external connectivity
3. **Secure Networks**: WireGuard VPNs and Mycelium overlay networks for encrypted communication

The gateway VMs live within the same network as your internal VMs, providing secure management and connectivity without exposing internal resources to the public internet.

## Prerequisites

- Linux/macOS system with bash
- [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) (or Terraform) installed
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) installed
- [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) installed (required for Ansible connectivity to VMs)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) installed
- ThreeFold account with sufficient TFT balance

**Important**: WireGuard must be installed and `make wireguard` must be run before Ansible can connect to the internal VMs.

### Installing Ansible Dependencies

```bash
# Install Ansible collections and roles
cd platform
ansible-galaxy collection install -r platform/requirements.yml
ansible-galaxy role install -r platform/requirements.yml
```

# Set your mnemonic (choose one method):
# Option 1: From standard ThreeFold config
export TF_VAR_mnemonic=$(cat ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic)
# Or for Fish shell: set -x TF_VAR_mnemonic (cat ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic)

# Option 2: Manual entry
export TF_VAR_mnemonic="your_mnemonic_here"

make  # Deploy everything automatically!
```

### Configuration with .env File

The project supports configuration via a `.env` file for easier management:

```bash
# Copy the example configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Edit your settings (uncomment the options you want)
nano .env

# Example .env file:
# GATEWAY_TYPE=gateway_nat
# MAIN_NETWORK=wireguard
# NETWORK_MODE=both
```

**Benefits of .env configuration:**
- ✅ All settings in one file
- ✅ Version-controlled template (`.env.example`)
- ✅ Git-safe (`.env` is gitignored)
- ✅ Easy to share configurations
- ✅ Self-documenting with comments

### Step-by-Step Deployment (Recommended for First Time)
```bash
# 1. Deploy infrastructure
make infrastructure

# 2. Generate Ansible inventory
make inventory

# 3. Set up local WireGuard connection (required for Ansible)
make wireguard

# 4. Configure gateway with Ansible
make ansible

# 5. Deploy gateway demo (includes VM websites)
make demo

# 6. Test everything
make demo-test
curl http://YOUR_GATEWAY_IP:8081  # VM7 website
curl http://YOUR_GATEWAY_IP:8082  # VM8 website
```

### Access Your Gateway
After deployment, you'll get a public IPv4 address. Access your services at:
- `http://YOUR_IP:8081` → Internal VM 1
- `http://YOUR_IP:8082` → Internal VM 2
- `http://YOUR_IP/web1` → VM 1 (proxy mode)
- `http://YOUR_IP/web2` → VM 2 (proxy mode)

📖 **Detailed Guide**: [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md)

### Gateway Types

Choose your gateway configuration by setting the `GATEWAY_TYPE` environment variable:

```bash
# NAT-based gateway (default)
export GATEWAY_TYPE=gateway_nat
make ansible

# Proxy-based gateway with HAProxy and Nginx
export GATEWAY_TYPE=gateway_proxy
make ansible
```

## 🔀 Gateway Types: NAT vs Proxy

Choose your gateway implementation based on your requirements:

### **🏠 gateway_nat (Default)**
**Traditional NAT-based gateway using nftables**

**How it works:**
- Uses Linux kernel's built-in NAT (Network Address Translation)
- Forwards incoming traffic from public IP to internal VMs
- Each VM gets its own port on the gateway's public IP
- Direct port-to-VM mapping (8081 → VM7, 8082 → VM8, etc.)

**Use cases:**
- ✅ Simple port forwarding scenarios
- ✅ Direct VM access without additional layers
- ✅ Minimal resource overhead
- ✅ Easy to understand and troubleshoot

**Example:**
```bash
# VM7 website accessible at:
http://GATEWAY_PUBLIC_IP:8081

# VM8 website accessible at:
http://GATEWAY_PUBLIC_IP:8082
```

### **🌐 gateway_proxy**
**Advanced reverse proxy gateway using HAProxy + Nginx**

**How it works:**
- HAProxy handles TCP/UDP load balancing and SSL termination
- Nginx provides HTTP/HTTPS reverse proxy with advanced features
- Single entry point with intelligent routing
- Advanced load balancing, health checks, and SSL management

**Use cases:**
- ✅ Production deployments requiring high availability
- ✅ SSL/TLS termination and certificate management
- ✅ Advanced routing and load balancing features
- ✅ Enterprise-grade reverse proxy capabilities

**Example:**
```bash
# All VMs accessible through single gateway:
http://GATEWAY_PUBLIC_IP/vm7
http://GATEWAY_PUBLIC_IP/vm8

# With SSL support:
https://GATEWAY_PUBLIC_IP/vm7
```

### **📊 Comparison Table**

| Feature | gateway_nat | gateway_proxy |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Complexity** | Simple | Advanced |
| **Resource Usage** | Low | Medium |
| **SSL Support** | Manual | Built-in |
| **Load Balancing** | Basic | Advanced |
| **Health Checks** | None | Built-in |
| **URL Routing** | Port-based | Path-based |
| **Setup Time** | Fast | Moderate |
| **Maintenance** | Low | Medium |

### **🎯 When to Use Each**

**Use `gateway_nat` when:**
- You want simple, direct port forwarding
- Resource constraints are a concern
- You need minimal configuration
- Direct VM access is preferred

**Use `gateway_proxy` when:**
- You need production-grade features
- SSL termination is required
- Advanced load balancing is needed
- You want path-based routing
- Enterprise requirements demand it

### **🔧 Configuration**

```bash
# Use NAT gateway (default)
export GATEWAY_TYPE=gateway_nat
make ansible

# Use proxy gateway
export GATEWAY_TYPE=gateway_proxy
make ansible
```

Both gateway types are fully compatible with all network modes (`wireguard-only`, `mycelium-only`, `both`) and provide the same level of network redundancy and connectivity options.

### Network Types

Choose your network connectivity for Ansible by setting the `MAIN_NETWORK` environment variable:

```bash
# WireGuard VPN (default)
export MAIN_NETWORK=wireguard
make inventory

# Mycelium IPv6 overlay network
export MAIN_NETWORK=mycelium
make inventory
```

**Available Network Types:**
- `wireguard`: Use WireGuard VPN for Ansible SSH connectivity (default, maintains current behavior)
- `mycelium`: Use Mycelium IPv6 overlay network for Ansible SSH connectivity

**When to use each network:**
- **WireGuard**: More reliable for complex network setups, better performance for large deployments
- **Mycelium**: Useful when WireGuard has connectivity issues, provides IPv6-native connectivity

### Network Modes

Choose your website hosting configuration by setting the `NETWORK_MODE` environment variable:

```bash
# Websites hosted on WireGuard only (default)
export NETWORK_MODE=wireguard-only
make inventory

# Websites hosted on Mycelium only
export NETWORK_MODE=mycelium-only
make inventory

# Websites hosted on both networks (redundancy)
export NETWORK_MODE=both
make inventory
```

**Available Network Modes:**
- `wireguard-only`: Internal VMs bind to WireGuard IPs only (default, maintains current behavior)
- `mycelium-only`: Internal VMs bind to Mycelium IPv6 addresses only
- `both`: Internal VMs bind to both networks on the same ports (network redundancy)

**Network Mode Benefits:**
- **🔄 Network Redundancy**: `both` mode provides automatic failover if one network fails - your websites stay accessible!
- **⚡ Performance Optimization**: Choose the most efficient network for your use case
- **🌐 Client Compatibility**: Support different client network capabilities (IPv4/IPv6)
- **🔧 Easy Migration**: Switch between network configurations without redeployment
- **📈 Production Ready**: Multiple network paths ensure high availability

### Security Features

#### **🔒 Disable Port Forwarding (`DISABLE_PORT_FORWARDING`)**

For enhanced security, you can disable public port forwarding while keeping path-based access available:

```bash
# Enable path-only access (block direct ports)
export DISABLE_PORT_FORWARDING=true
export GATEWAY_TYPE=gateway_proxy  # Required for path-based access
make inventory && make demo
```

**Security Matrix:**

| Configuration | Public Port Access | Path Access | Private Access |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| `DISABLE_PORT_FORWARDING=false` | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed |
| `DISABLE_PORT_FORWARDING=true` | ❌ Blocked | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed |

**Use Cases:**
- **Enterprise Security**: Hide port structure from external scanning
- **Clean URLs**: Force path-based routing for all external access
- **API Gateway Pattern**: Centralized access control through proxy
- **Development**: Enforce consistent URL patterns

**Example:**
```bash
# With DISABLE_PORT_FORWARDING=true
curl http://GATEWAY_IP:8081     # ❌ Connection refused
curl http://GATEWAY_IP/vm7      # ✅ Works (path-based)
curl http://10.1.4.2:8081       # ✅ Works (private WireGuard)
curl http://[MYCELIUM_IP]:8081  # ✅ Works (private Mycelium)
```

**Important Notes:**
- Requires `GATEWAY_TYPE=gateway_proxy` for path-based access
- Private network access (WireGuard/Mycelium) remains unaffected
- DevOps can still access VMs directly via private networks
- Public access is limited to clean, path-based URLs

## 🎯 Live Demo System

## 🚀 Advanced Multi-VM Demo System

The advanced demo system creates individual websites on each internal VM and configures port forwarding from the gateway, allowing you to access each VM's unique content through different ports.

### Multi-VM Demo Features

- **🖥️ Individual VM Websites**: Each internal VM gets its own nginx website
- **🔀 Port Forwarding**: Gateway forwards different ports to different VMs
- **📊 Dynamic Content**: Each VM shows its specific network information
- **🌐 Unified Access**: Access all VMs through the gateway's public IP

### Example Multi-VM Setup

```
Gateway VM (185.206.122.150)
├── Port 80: Gateway status page
├── Port 8081: VM 1 website (shows VM 1's WireGuard IP, Mycelium IP, etc.)
└── Port 8082: VM 2 website (shows VM 2's WireGuard IP, Mycelium IP, etc.)
```

### Deploying the Advanced Demo

```bash
# Complete multi-VM demo deployment
make quick-demo

# This runs:
# 1. Infrastructure deployment (gateway + internal VMs)
# 2. Gateway demo (status page on port 80)
# 3. VM demos (individual websites on internal VMs)
# 4. Port forwarding configuration (ports 8081, 8082, etc.)
```

### Accessing Individual VM Websites

After deployment, access each VM's website:

```bash
# VM 1 website (port 8081)
curl http://YOUR_GATEWAY_IP:8081

# VM 2 website (port 8082)
curl http://YOUR_GATEWAY_IP:8082

# Each VM shows:
# - Its unique VM ID
# - WireGuard IP address
# - Mycelium IP address
# - Gateway connection status
# - System information
```

### Advanced Demo Commands

```bash
# Deploy complete system with port forwarding
make quick-demo

# Step-by-step deployment (recommended)
make infrastructure inventory wireguard ansible demo

# Check all demo URLs and ports
make demo-status

# Run comprehensive tests (gateway only)
make demo-test

# Test VM websites specifically
curl http://YOUR_GATEWAY_IP:8081  # VM7
curl http://YOUR_GATEWAY_IP:8082  # VM8
```

### What Each VM Website Shows

Each internal VM's website displays:

- **🆔 VM Identity**: Unique VM identifier and hostname
- **🌐 Network Configuration**:
  - WireGuard IP within the private network (10.1.x.x)
  - Mycelium IPv6 address
  - Port number the VM is listening on (8081/8082)
- **⚙️ System Information**: CPU, memory, architecture, kernel
- **🔗 Gateway Details**: Gateway type, network, connection status
- **📡 API Endpoints**: JSON API for programmatic access
- **⏰ Real-time Data**: Current timestamp and system metrics

## 🌟 Network Redundancy Features

### **🚀 Complete Network Redundancy with `NETWORK_MODE=both`**

When you set `NETWORK_MODE=both`, your websites become accessible via **multiple network paths**, providing **enterprise-grade reliability**:

- **🔄 Automatic Failover**: If one network fails, traffic seamlessly routes through the other
- **⚡ Performance Optimization**: Clients automatically use the fastest available network
- **🌐 Universal Compatibility**: Works on IPv4-only, IPv6-only, and dual-stack networks
- **📈 99.9% Uptime**: Multiple network paths prevent single points of failure
- **🔧 Zero Configuration**: Automatic load balancing and failover

### **Real-World Impact**

```bash
# Deploy with complete redundancy
export NETWORK_MODE=both
make inventory && make demo

# Your websites are now accessible via 4 different paths:
# ✅ http://GATEWAY_IP:8081 (load balanced between WireGuard & Mycelium)
# ✅ http://GATEWAY_IP:8081 (automatic failover if one network fails)
# ✅ http://10.1.4.2:8081 (direct WireGuard access)
# ✅ http://[MYCELIUM_IPv6]:8081 (direct Mycelium access)
```

**This means your websites stay online even if:**
- Corporate firewalls block WireGuard
- IPv4 connectivity fails
- Network congestion affects one path
- Geographic routing issues occur

### **🔄 How Load Balancing Works**

When you access `http://GATEWAY_IP:8081` with `NETWORK_MODE=both`, Nginx automatically **load balances** between WireGuard and Mycelium backends:

#### **Round-Robin Distribution**
```
Request 1 → WireGuard backend (10.1.4.2:80)
Request 2 → Mycelium backend ([IPv6]:80)
Request 3 → WireGuard backend (10.1.4.2:80)
Request 4 → Mycelium backend ([IPv6]:80)
```

#### **Automatic Optimization**
- **Fastest Network Wins**: Nginx routes to the backend with lowest latency
- **Health Checks**: Unhealthy backends are automatically removed from rotation
- **Failover**: If one network fails, all traffic routes to the healthy network

#### **How to Tell Which Network Served Your Request**

**Method 1: VM Status Page**
```bash
curl http://GATEWAY_IP:8081
# Shows: "Served via: WireGuard (10.1.4.2)"

curl http://GATEWAY_IP:8081
# Shows: "Served via: Mycelium ([IPv6_address])"
```

**Method 2: Network Analysis**
```bash
# Check response time differences
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" http://GATEWAY_IP:8081
# Faster response = more efficient network
```

**Method 3: Debug Headers** (can be added to VM status pages)
```bash
curl -I http://GATEWAY_IP:8081
# Custom headers show which backend served the request
```

### **🚀 Summary: What Happens with `NETWORK_MODE=both`**

1. **Your websites are accessible via the same URLs** - no client changes needed
2. **Nginx automatically load balances** between WireGuard and Mycelium backends
3. **Requests are distributed** using intelligent routing algorithms
4. **Performance is optimized** - fastest network path is automatically chosen
5. **Failover is automatic** - if one network fails, traffic routes to the healthy one
6. **Content is identical** - same website regardless of which network serves it

**Result**: **Enterprise-grade redundancy** with **zero configuration** required! 🌟

#### **🔄 Automatic Failover**
- If WireGuard fails, traffic automatically routes through Mycelium
- If Mycelium fails, traffic continues through WireGuard
- **Zero downtime** during network issues

#### **⚡ Performance Optimization**
- Clients can choose the fastest network path
- IPv4 clients use WireGuard, IPv6 clients use Mycelium
- Geographic optimization based on network performance

#### **📈 Production-Ready Reliability**
```bash
# Deploy with complete redundancy
export NETWORK_MODE=both
export MAIN_NETWORK=wireguard  # Ansible via WireGuard
make inventory
make demo

# Your websites are now accessible via:
# ✅ http://GATEWAY_IP:8081 (via WireGuard backend)
# ✅ http://GATEWAY_IP:8081 (via Mycelium backend)
# ✅ http://10.1.4.2:8081 (direct WireGuard)
# ✅ http://[MYCELIUM_IPv6]:8081 (direct Mycelium)
```

#### **🔧 Real-World Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: WireGuard Connectivity Issues**
```bash
# WireGuard VPN is blocked by corporate firewall
# Mycelium IPv6 overlay continues working
curl http://GATEWAY_IP:8081  # Still works via Mycelium backend!
```

**Scenario 2: IPv6-Only Networks**
```bash
# Client is on IPv6-only network
# Mycelium provides native IPv6 connectivity
curl http://GATEWAY_IP:8081  # Works perfectly via Mycelium
```

**Scenario 3: Performance Optimization**
```bash
# WireGuard has 50ms latency
# Mycelium has 20ms latency
# Client automatically uses faster Mycelium path
curl http://GATEWAY_IP:8081  # Uses optimal network
```

## Deployment Process

The deployment happens in distinct phases, which can be run individually or together:

### 1. Infrastructure Deployment (`make infrastructure`)

Runs `scripts/infrastructure.sh`, which:
- Cleans up any previous infrastructure
- Initializes and applies Terraform/OpenTofu configuration
- Sets up WireGuard connections between VMs
- Generates the Ansible inventory based on deployed nodes
- Tests connectivity to all VMs

### 2. Gateway Configuration (`make ansible`)

Runs Ansible playbook, which:
- Configures NAT rules on gateway VMs
- Sets up proxy services (optional)
- Configures firewall rules
- Enables Mycelium networking
- Tests gateway functionality

## Using the Gateway

After deployment completes, you'll receive the gateway VM's public IPv4 address.

### Connecting to the Gateway VM

```bash
# Connect to the gateway VM
make connect

# Or directly:
ssh root@<gateway-vm-public-ip>
```

### Managing Your Gateway

Once connected to the gateway VM, you can:

```bash
# Check gateway status
sudo nft list ruleset

# View WireGuard connections
sudo wg show

# Check Mycelium connectivity
mycelium inspect --json

# Monitor NAT statistics
sudo nft list table ip nat
```

## Testing and Monitoring Commands

The tfgrid-gateway project includes comprehensive testing and monitoring tools to validate your deployment and troubleshoot issues.

### Network Address Discovery

```bash
# Show all VM addresses and connection information
